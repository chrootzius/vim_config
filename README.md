# Vim config

Nothing to fancy just my vim config.

My goal is to use as less plugins as possible. To make my configuration useable
on any system.

## Installed Plugins

- [nerdcommenter](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdcommenter)
- [airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline)
- [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox)
