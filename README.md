# Vim config

Nothing to fancy just my vim config.

My goal is to use as less plugins as possible. To make my configuration useable
on any system.

All used plugins are written in plain VimL and a little bash.

## Installed Plugins

- [airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline)
- [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox)
- [incsearch](https://github.com/haya14busa/incsearch.vim)

## Installation

```
$ cd $HOME
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/oliverwigers/vim_config .vim
$ cd .vim
$ stow vimrc
```
