# Vim config

Nothing to fancy just my vim config.

Once I was trying to solve as many problems without plugins and came up with 
solutions replacing plugins like
[Nerdcommenter](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdcommenter). But at some point
I noticed I was reinventing the wheel. It was a great journey and I learned alot
about Vim. 

In the end I started using plugins again.
